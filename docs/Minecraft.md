# Minecraft Server

Minecraft server is run with Java. There are numerous ways to accomplish this, but the first thing that is required is to locate the `server.jar` file required to run the server. This can be downloaded free of charge from Minecraft's website [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/). Once the `.jar` file has been downloaded to your machine, you can in theory run the Minecraft server. There are a few things to note if you have never done this before. The first big one is that Minecraft server requires that you accept its EULA. This is fairly easy on its own, but later on we will need a way to automate this without having to do the manual method. The other is setting defaults on what the server can use. This is done by calling flags while executing the file.
