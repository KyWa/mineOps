# mineOps Series Stream

This is the streaming series of the previous, blog-only series, `mineOps`. All of the articles for the `mineOps` series can be found on my blog at: https://blog.kywa.io

Supporting repository can be found here: https://github.com/KyWa/mineOps

## Focus of the Stream

To go over the entire `mineOps` and watch it happen live. This presents the viewers/readers the ability to see what is actually happening as opposed to just reading a blog. Through this medium people can ask questions about "why" or "how" something is done.

## Stream Episodes

Each episode of the stream will cover 1 part of the `mineOps` series. Links can be found below for each of the articles in order:

* [Part 1 - Manual Minecraft Server Installation](https://blog.kywa.io/mineops-part-1/)
* [Part 2 - Automating with Ansible](https://blog.kywa.io/mineops-part-2/)
* [Part 3 - Keeping it Altogether with Git](https://blog.kywa.io/mineops-part-3/)
* [Part 4 - Containers Have Joined the Party](https://blog.kywa.io/mineops-part-4/)
* [Part 5 - Making Containers Highly Available](https://blog.kywa.io/mineops-part-5/)
* [Part 6 - ArgoCD to the Rescue](https://blog.kywa.io/mineops-part-6/)

Due to the nature of some of the later parts in this series (notable 4 and 5), those episodes may become 2 parters as the concepts of Containers and Kubernetes can take some time to go through.
