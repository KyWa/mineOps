## Learning Git

Git at first may appear complicated as there may be a lot of new words that get used, however `git` is pretty straightforward once you get past the lingo. The items we are going to focus on are as follows:

* Installing Git
* Understanding key Git terms
    * Local repository
    * Remote repository
    * Index
    * Commit
    * Branches
* Setting up Git
    * Configuration
    * Local repository
    * Remote repositories
* Using Git to version control our Ansible files

## Using Git with a team

Now for the fun part, using `git` within a team. Things changes slightly when working with a team out of a `git` repository, but only when it comes to your workflow. The commands all stay the same. The key items when working with a team to consider are (and in no particular order):

* Which branch you are on
* Commit status
* Merge Conflicts
